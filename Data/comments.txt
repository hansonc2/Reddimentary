I think this trend is unavoidable without an unrealistically large shift in our culture both on and offline in terms of ideological inclusiveness.The other angle that appears to me is to more strictly regulate news media to stop the spread of disinformation and hateful rhetoric. That again seems to be a nonstarter on the lines of first amendment proprotections and mistrust of the government.$$$$$Hi `AsAModerate`. Thank you for participating in /r/Politics.

Let's talk about Comey and his press conference.  I thought she should have been indicted to be honest with you.  Her handling of every aspect of the email scandal, from setting it up to "wiping it with a cloth".  She demonstrated that she lacks basic good judgement, actually she has demonstrated very poor judgement.  Anyone that doesn't believe that her actions were less than careless has to been the most die hard and devoted of Hillary supporters.Your imagination seem to have no boundaries as I am sure you will be hard pressed to show where I have gone out of my way to praise Comey, like I said, I thought the result was wrong.I am pretty sure Bill gets called dishonest as much as Hillary.  Why do you want to turn this into a sexist thing when I have not inferred anything sexist, implied anything  sexist nor said anything that could be sanely construed as sexist.  Methinks you  doth protest to much.You belong to the delusional core that believes in Hillary's magic wand, you know the one she uses when she wants "to get things done".  A wand of unlimited power that causes the Republicans to put off their impeachment hearings (you know they are coming if the House stays Republican) and instead work with the politician that they hate and want to see fail even more than Obama.  If you actually wanted results you would have worked for one of the other Democratic candidates that were running.  Hillary has no history of "getting things done", it is simply a myth.When money influences policy that is corruption.

Russia integrates it's military intelligence into civilian populaces.  Twice now the Russian forces have integrated their forces into populaces of two independent countries: Georgia and Ukraine.

Remember when "binders full of women" was somehow made into a big deal? That's what the average uninformed voter thinks that all this stuff about Trump amounts to. Nothing sticks to him because the press has a history of making mountains out of mole hills. So when the press actually finds Mount friggin' Everest, no one pays attention.$$$$$Treason in the US is only for aiding or abetting entities that the US is at war with. We are not at war with russia and therefore it would not be treason. However, it would probably lead to some very messy senate hearings!$$$$$[removed]$$$$$Politifact would rate this development as "Mostly False."$$$$$Does anyone here think CNN did the wrong thing here? Why? And does anyone deny that Donna Brazille did nothing wrong?$$$$$Then of course at some point the bear gets a cheap shot in and the old man is down and out on the ground.*Que sweet harmonica riff*Bah God! Thats Tim Kaine's music!$$$$$so you are saying that you assume people are guilty, at least guilty enough to not vote for them simply because there is an investigation?$$$$$He was out of line for sparing Clinton. She could be in jail by now.$$$$$Much like Obama, Bill Clinton had a conservative-majority Congress. They voted in favor of DOMA, and even though Clinton said that he didn't want to sign it into law, he really had no choice because they had a "veto-proof majority" against him.It sucked, but getting something as progressive as DADT through a conservative, grid-locked congress required compromise. They had already thrown a tantrum and staged a government shut-down, so he wanted to try and avoid having another one.$$$$$I believe some may, and he could temper the worst of others, yes. Also, he's directly opposed to Trump, who definitely wouldn't. Personally I think the 'corporate overlord' angle is pretty overstated. She's no different than a lot of politicians in that regard, which I suppose is what people are voting against, at least in part if they go Trump.$$$$$&gt;Why would that context matter?Well for one thing, if the kid is lying about everything that matters. If the kid is a total asshole and constantly interrupts the class and causes trouble, that matters. If the teacher was specifically talking about the student individually, as opposed to being happy that all Muslim refugees will be deported, that matters too.So yeah context does matter, well unless you're an idiot. &gt;The stupid could have murdered another student and it still would be beyond fucked up for the teacher to say they can't wait for a muslim student to be deported.I strongly disagree and find it pathetic that you'd still find it "beyond fucked." Are you really that fucking politically correct? Jesus that is sad.$$$$$That's how it works.

Thanks patriot.$$$$$[deleted]$$$$$I am afraid that some candidates won't look at it that way. Instead, they may calculate that Trump lost primarily because of his indiscipline, narcissistic personality and not-traditionally-conservative political views, not because he didn't release his tax returns.$$$$$except the Veritas videos actually had FEC filings to back them up. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R7A3Qz60tQ$$$$$I'm a Sanders supporter and I have known Hillary was a shady opportunistic politician since the 90's.  I believe she has engaged in selling access to government via her foundation.  The DNC and her campaign most certainly pulled all the tricks to suppress the surge of support behind Sanders in the primary.  However, I have also known Trump to be a shady crooked leach with a disgusting sexist personae and a history of racial discrimination dating back to the 80s.  As bad as Clinton is at least she is competent in regards to how public policy works.  Trump is a boorish stupid clod proposing ideas based on bigotry, fear mongering and straight up fascism.  As bad as Clinton is Trump is far far far worse.  I wish to God he wasn't, I really do, but that man is a shit stain beyond comprehension.$$$$$*it is important to the extent possible to keep the debates "multicandidate" and to eliminate the possibility of one on one debates*Wanted to limit Sanders air time as much as possible.$$$$$Naaa; You'd still whine and complain$$$$$[deleted]   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.9428  &gt; [What is this?](https://pastebin.com/64GuVi2F/90238)$$$$$&gt; What proof? Proof that the US government has officially lodged a complaint against Russian state actors for hacking into the DNC servers.Ah. So allegations is all it takes to determine guilt? Guess Hillary shouldn't have mishandled Top Secret information, she must be guilty now.And I see no official complaint with the UN or anybody about Russia hacks. Whining about shit to the media is not official, it just shows the lengths that Obama and Hillary will go to to lie to the American public.$$$$$Rizzoto!$$$$$[deleted]$$$$$No. I'm saying ICMP is usually blocked on most servers to the entire outside world. Usually routers and switches respond to pings. You don't have to ping a server to be able to communicate with it.$$$$$Because there's too much power and money at stake. nice guys finish last. Vote Trump$$$$$If the goal was an October surprise then they've got a very short window to pull the trigger. If Trump loses next Tuesday it loses some of its clickability.$$$$$the only problem I have with this is that Rushdie lumps a bunch of stuff in with the allegation, when the allegation itself is very powerful.  It really diminishes the allegation, and frankly makes me very suspicious of it.More effective would be the following example: "Bill Clinton is a sexual predator who has made many women victims going back to his time as Governor of Arkansas.  Hillary has systematically attacked the victims to achieve greater power for her and her family."See, more powerful because it doesn't throw a bunch of issues together into a big ole pile.  Much more effective (and in my example, true).$$$$$Saw the "Tired of being 50th?" signs while driving through. Had to laugh. How sad is that?$$$$$He fits the profile of an intelligence asset.  Money problems, an inflated sense of entitlement and self worth, connections in business and industry, a weakness for young foreign women, and a willingness to do or say anything for a short term advantage with very little regard for ethics (cheats on wife, fails to pay subcontractors, seems to dodge taxes).Edit: Holy Shit Mother Jones has posted an article alleging exactly this.  http://m.motherjones.com/politics/2016/10/veteran-spy-gave-fbi-info-alleging-russian-operation-cultivate-donald-trump$$$$$Because he is.$$$$$Hi `Dualspace`.

I don't really care because I know that if he started with the proper number that his speech would change accordingly. Trump is not an idiot.$$$$$All my snapchat nudes!$$$$$[deleted]$$$$$&gt;Ah yes, only I could possibly be at fault, there's no way at all that you could have misunderstood or misinterpreted what I said.Well, let's break it down and see.  Here is the comment you originally replied to:&gt;Oh and those darn Bernie supporters, turned out they were right about the DNC scheming against Sanders. Who would have thought?!So this comment is talking about the scheming that the DNC did against Sanders.  To which you replied:&gt;It's almost as if they didn't want someone who'd never done significant fundraising for them in the past to use all their money.Looking at this response in context of the comment it is responding to, there is no other way to interpret it's meaning other than it is giving justification for the action in the first comment which is 'DNC scheming against Sanders.'  You don't refute or deny the DNC schemed and in-fact give justification for it which is, '...they didn't want someone who'd never done significant fundraising for them in the past to use all their money.'Your response says nothing of any positive/negative impact on the People and only indicates a concern for who gets to spend the Democratic party's money.  It's also said in a manner as if it's obvious or acceptable for them to scheme against another candidate and this is only emphasized by your little 'Craaaazzzyyyyyy' at the end.  So to answer your question, no, there is no way I misunderstood what you said.  Now if what you said is not what you meant, that's not my fault for misunderstanding.  That's your fault for writing poorly and misrepresenting yourself.  If what you said is what you meant, then you care more about the party than you do the People.  Since you are justifying the DNC corruptly favoring a known liar--that being Hillary, just in-case it wasn't clear--over doing what they are supposed to be doing, which is be impartial to all Democratic candidates regardless where they came from before.  $$$$$It might depend on the state. This was all executed by micro targeting. Bill De Blasio described the Brooklyn fiasco as effecting specific buildings and blocks.$$$$$&gt;That copypasta is uninformed drivel.Wrong. (This seems to be what works with my comrades over in Trumpland.)$$$$$It was over every news site earlier that Obama said Comey had integrity and wasn't tipping the scales. There's some record correction going on is all. Damage control$$$$$It's not that challenging.  People do it all the time.  Setting up a server that's As Secure As You Could Reasonably Expect is a push-button affair these days.$$$$$More importantly, are they running for President while denying any and all financial and political ties with Russia?$$$$$Naaa; You'd still whine and complain$$$$$Like Icarus swept away in a mirage of air and magic, birds and song, one can dream ... Alas poor Bernie.$$$$$Still waiting for those classified emails to be released by whoever hacked Clinton's server.$$$$$What you saw is multiple police forces unable to protect themselves from a SINGLE shooter. I agree that 5 killed at once is a lot, but there was only one dude shooting at them. Hardly a war.And then he was killed by an exploding drone. An American on American soil was killes by a drone.$$$$$Vote 3rd party and avoid it all.$$$$$&gt; The warrant I linked to is for Clinton's emails, a warrant for Weiner's computer had already been issued and the new emails are covered under the new warrant, and thus should be admissible.They obtained that warrant only yesterday. They went snooping through Huma's account weeks ago searching for emails from Clinton's server, while ostensibly searching *Weiner's* accounts for child pornography. Whatever warrant they obtained to search Weiner's accounts for child pornography would *not* have covered searching Huma's accounts for Clinton emails.A number of legal experts have analyzed this and agree that this search/seizure was unconstitutional:* https://lawfareblog.com/did-fourth-amendment-require-fbi-selectively-seize-weiners-emails* https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2016/10/30/was-it-legal-for-the-fbi-to-expand-the-weiner-email-search-to-target-hillary-clintons-emails/&gt; I was under the impression that the emails were on Weiner's computer in a folder titled 'Life insurance', not in an account elsewhere, would you share a source?Only according to alt right conspiracy theorists. http://www.snopes.com/huma-abedin-insurance/$$$$$Irregular DNS lookups from another country? There can only be one conclusion.$$$$$[deleted]$$$$$Holy shit    &gt;And a former senior intelligence officer for a Western country who specialized in Russian counterintelligence tells Mother Jones that in recent months he provided the bureau with memos, based on his recent interactions with Russian sources, contending the Russian government has for years tried to co-opt and assist Trumpand that the FBI requested more information from him.    ....    &gt;Mother Jones has reviewed that report and other memos this former spy wrote. The first memo, based on the former intelligence officer's conversations with Russian sources, noted, "Russian regime has been cultivating, supporting and assisting TRUMP for at least 5 years. Aim, endorsed by PUTIN, has been to encourage splits and divisions in western alliance." It maintained that Trump "and his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the Kremlin, including on his Democratic and other political rivals." It claimed that Russian intelligence had "compromised" Trump during his visits to Moscow and could "blackmail him." It also reported that Russian intelligence had compiled a dossier on Hillary Clinton based on "bugged conversations she had on various visits to Russia and intercepted phone calls."$$$$$Look at what Bill Clinton did in 1992 and 1996 for progressives, it ain't much.$$$$$But for the kind of analysis that is described in the article, they would need actual query logs, which they could only obtain by court order(?)$$$$$[removed]$$$$$We clearly aren't talking about the same thing.

It just sounds very VERY wtfucky.$$$$$Having the private email server is itself a federal crime. &gt;But she was found innocent for that in the first investigation!(Lol that I have to now to refer to which FBI investigation Hillary Clinton was/is under)Her campaign donated $600k+ to Comey's wife during her first investigation. I don't know about you, but that sounds like a big, fat bribe.She won't get away so easy this time.$$$$$[deleted]$$$$$&gt;Bernie primaries, Trump nowThat's quite the swing. Just going to burn everything to the ground?$$$$$So he lied?  Or do you think that maybe they knew what they had through examining metadata?$$$$$Probably because "the Russians" didn't do it. Look Podesta emails revealed that he was socially engineered a few times (likes to clickly the linky that one), Wikileaks heavily implied that the DNC leaks were just that, leaks by an insider (most probably [Seth Rich](http://www.newsweek.com/seth-rich-murder-dnc-hack-julian-assange-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-492084)), and Guiciffer while maybe a Russian is probably just someone who likes to fuck with people.Lieing to benefit one party over another isn't really where Comey wants to take the FBI.$$$$$This should be easy to push back against since there is no such fucking thing as demons. What percentage think she's a goblin, a ghoul, or a spook?$$$$$That makes no sense. The outcome isn't known until the investigation is concluded so it could end up being a waste of time. Also, who gets determine if it is valid?$$$$$Press Secretary/Cartoon-Nazi-Frog Buster $$$$$I stand corrected. He is merely acting like a traitor.$$$$$You really would have fucked with their heads if you told them that the creator of the Big Bang Theory was a priest.$$$$$being careless with classified information is in fact criminal negligence. It's less that he didn't think so and more that its HRC he was investigating. The congressional hearing pretty much sums it up. She's on tape saying she didn't send any info marked classified. Whoops. The fact that she was never put under oath should raise all the red flags you need.$$$$$Then restrict the pollution with actual laws and make a commitment on the issue for once, instead of just introducing what is essentially a new tax. Taxes have never stopped anyone, there is always a way around and always a loophole. Instead of saying "aw, well, just give us $250 million for those carbon emissions" we should say "well, sucks, figure it out and adapt, but you can't pump that into the atmosphere. At all. No if's, and's, or but's".$$$$$Reddit has been "left" since its inception. Not sure why that's a surprise to you...$$$$$Oh god this is priceless.$$$$$Look, it doesn't take elite state-sponsored hackers to break into the email account of a guy like Podesta. He did almost nothing to keep his email secure. He had a weak password, emailed that password to coworkers, used that password for several accounts, was still using that password after having his emails leaked, fell for a phishing scam, and let other people access his email account.The Russian interference theory is an extraordinary claim, and extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. No such evidence has been presented thus far.$$$$$In Oregon, Kate Brown hasn't won an election yet. She became governor after Kitzhaber resigned over a scandal. We'll see if she can hold onto it. I'm somewhat concerned that there's a red backlash brewing in Oregon right now, although Portland is definitely staying solid blue.$$$$$incorrect idiot, yes. inciting crime, no.$$$$$The plot is that this action was such a threat to national security that she's being portrayed as the biggest political criminal of all time.  In fact Trump himself is out claiming this is the biggest scandal since watergate.  (In fact, if we're being accurate, which is never the case with Trump, the massive hacking of the DNC, Podesta, Colin Powell and others is literally an electronic watergate on a massive scale).Point remains we're castigating Hillary for sending/receiving email on a private server, meanwhile our private government servers aren't even secure.The entire concept behind the scandal is just absurd.$$$$$&gt;claimed that people with "non-leftist" opinions get shadowbans on this sub.This is the source of our miscommunication. If you go back and look, you will see that I claimed that it happens on Reddit in general. I did not claim that this sub does it$$$$$http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/06/hillary-clinton/fbi-findings-tear-holes-hillary-clintons-email-def/Clinton had repeatedly said she did not have any classified emails on her server, but the results of the FBI investigation show that claim was incorrect."Of the tens of thousands of emails investigators reviewed, 113 contained classified information, and three of those had classification markers. FBI Director James Comey has said Clinton should have known that some of the 113 were classified, but others she might have understandably missed."They found classified info, they didn't suggest charges because they couldn't prove intent to mishandle them. So yes there's evidence she did and thus lied to Congress and committed a crime.$$$$$&gt; The Regional governors now have direct control over their territories.

OKeefe has released video after video that were misleading, and were shown to be so when the full context was viewed.

This was for an opposition research project originally financed by a Republican client critical of the celebrity mogul. (Before the former spy was retained, the project's financing switched to a client allied with Democrats.) "It started off as a fairly general inquiry," says the former spook, who asks not to be identified. But when he dug into Trump, he notes, he came across troubling information indicating connections between Trump and the Russian government. According to his sources, he says, "there was an established exchange of information between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin of mutual benefit."&gt; &gt; Wow$$$$$So did Trump and then he said he wouldn't.

Assuming he wins the battleground states of florida, NC, ohio, iowa, nevada and arizona, then he has 259 votes if I didn't miscalculate.  The possible paths to victory are either flipping illinois, pennsylvania, michigan or virginia, or winning 2 of wisconsin, colorado and new mexico, with new hamshire and the 1 maine vote being possibilities. All that changes with utah is he only has to win 1 of those states instead of maybe needing 2.

And I think their foreign policy platform and social issues platforms are substantially better than the GOP.I would love a true left wing, but we also need to marginalize the far right. If you talk to most young Republicans their views are much closer to the Libertarian party than to the GOP platform. Conservative on economic policy issues, limited government, but very progressive on social issues. Unless there are unprecedented structural changes to the government, we'll continue having 2 parties regardless of what they're named, and I think a future with a libertarian-esque platform on the right and a green type platform on the left is the best outcome.

This shouldn't have happened in the first place, and it's wrong for you to say that it wouldn't have mattered anyway when it has clearly done so.$$$$$At this point I am not worried about the court judges anymore. With Garland the game has changed. The GOP has shown that they are willing to keep stalling the courts and keep refusing even moderate candidates like Garland. They have already promised to block any candidate that Hillary proposes and have even floated the idea of letting the court die out. What is to stop the dems from playing their game? If they ask for someone too far to the right keep denying them until they get what they want. Granted, they need a majority to do this, but it looks like dems will have it assuming this new email revelation hasn't harmed it any.$$$$$Clinton selling influence to foreign interests is not shitty? It trumps whatever Trump has done by 100000$$$$$Holy shit    &gt;And a former senior intelligence officer for a Western country who specialized in Russian counterintelligence tells Mother Jones that in recent months he provided the bureau with memos, based on his recent interactions with Russian sources, contending the Russian government has for years tried to co-opt and assist Trumpand that the FBI requested more information from him.    ....    &gt;Mother Jones has reviewed that report and other memos this former spy wrote. The first memo, based on the former intelligence officer's conversations with Russian sources, noted, "Russian regime has been cultivating, supporting and assisting TRUMP for at least 5 years. Aim, endorsed by PUTIN, has been to encourage splits and divisions in western alliance." It maintained that Trump "and his inner circle have accepted a regular flow of intelligence from the Kremlin, including on his Democratic and other political rivals." It claimed that Russian intelligence had "compromised" Trump during his visits to Moscow and could "blackmail him." It also reported that Russian intelligence had compiled a dossier on Hillary Clinton based on "bugged conversations she had on various visits to Russia and intercepted phone calls."$$$$$Da comrade, there are no Russian soldiers in Ukraine. Ukraine is Russia. Clinton is a lying shill woman who is terrible negotiator with glorious Putin.

The more free any country has become the better it has been. All countries are a success because they moved closer to libertarian philosophy. USA was the best in the 19th and 20th century because it had more freedom. China and India are pulling themselves into 1st world status because they have more freedom.

No. If you cut out the 3 previous true answers does it sound horrible? Yes. All four statements in context with her seriously saying "no, no, no" then smiling and joking at lunch "a lamborghini".

It's going to be a bombshell and people are going to prison, stuff like that. Because of the national security implications this investigation is being held closer to the chest; a lot fewer people internally know about it so they can better control leaks.Comey and the FBI have been heavily criticized for not recommending charges against Clinton in July. If that was followed up with bringing down the hammer on Trump there'd be tremendous partisan backlash. "Comey's in the pocket of the Clintons and sending their enemies to jail", etc. Comey perceives this and worries the FBI will be seen as a partisan actor. There's tremendous pressure and that's manifested as this sloppy decision to announce the investigation of more emails of Clinton's. Comey knows it looks like shit but thinks it will provide some insulation to the coming bombshell, which is the important thing.**Edit**: [This new NY Times story](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/01/us/politics/fbi-russia-election-donald-trump.html) directly disputes this theory.$$$$$A ban on the fossil fuels would hurt the poor the most.$$$$$My guess is here on Reddit many of his supporters are Russians.$$$$$What last time?

Why wash your hands with her and not Cory Lewandowski?" Terrel J Starr5) " I  have no issue with Donna Brazile leaving CNN, IF Corey Lewandowsky had to go, too. His presence alone is free advertising for Trump." Terrell6) " What I find odd is that CNN pretends it is "uncomfortable" with Donna Brazile's actions. Really?

If Hillary was given the questions ahead of time, why didn't she report Donna to CNN or to an authority figure?

That means they have to try not to piss off either side too badly. And that means trying to give a roughly equal amount of positive and negative coverage to either side, to achieve "balance" instead of fairness. When the quality of the candidates is grossly imbalanced, any push toward balance is effectively a bias in favor of the worst candidate. I would argue that unbiased reporting should forget about balance and instead focus on holding candidates to the same standard. That is, any statement or action should be judged by the same standards regardless of which candidate made it. By this standard, the entire media--including MSNBC--has been grossly biased toward Trump, even if they have much more negative coverage of him overall. That's because they let Trump get away with saying dozens of things every day that would sink Hillary Clinton's or anyone else's campaign. His entire stump speech is more incoherent than Rick Perry's "oops" moment, but nobody bats an eye. Meanwhile, all their negative coverage of Hillary is for things that wouldn't even crack Trumps top 100 scandals.$$$$$But voting for some other write-in candidate wouldn't be a wasted vote?

You mentioned it several times but didn't really clarify?Now I can't tell if I'm being trolled. Take any of the European countries I've listed. In any of my posts in this chain. And tell me which ones are worse to live in than the US. Denmark, France, Germany, Sweden, Norway, etc. Pick any one and explain to me why the average citizen has a better life in the US than in any of those countries. I've given you the metrics I use, so it shouldn't be hard. How long you live, the purchasing power of your salary, bankruptcy due to illness, median household income, etc. I'm not saying any have it *all* figured out, just that they can somehow have universal health care without collapsing, why can't we?&gt; Questions, Not a conservative "talking point".LOL, come on man. Be serious. I told you where the money would come from several posts ago. Taxes. You're just trained to keep asking the question even after the answer has been given. That's the definition of a talking point. &gt; Your economics are flawed though... Money that sits in savings, and funds are inserted back into the economy in a **far more productive manner** than just passing it out to poor people through social services.Really? We have more money sitting in savings and investments now than any time in history...how are we doing economically? Seriously. I'd love to learn how Keynesian economics *didn't* get us out of the great depression. Poor people don't have discretionary income. They spend everything they have to live. That money goes right back into the economy. 100% of a wage increase given to a poor worker goes back into the consumer economy. They don't save, b/c they still have basic needs unmet. On the other hand, money given to a millionaire gets saved. Sure, that money can then be lent out, but what company takes out a loan if they don't have people buying their goods? Companies don't hire more workers because they have more money, they hire more workers when they *have* to. When there's enough demand for your goods or services and your current operation can't fulfill it all, *then* you hire more workers. You don't just do it b/c you got more money. Also, My point is that the super rich don't just save in banks, they save in off-shore, untaxed shell companies. They literally take money out of the economy. They take it an put it overseas, and don't pay taxes on it. If you're curious how much they do this, check out any of the reporting about the panama papers. Your argument is flawed in that it assumes an all or nothing approach. Just because we tax rich people more doesn't mean there won't be any savings anymore. It means there will be less at the top 1%, but that will be more than made up for by consumer spending. You've got the basic conservative talking points about supply-side economics down, but they're based on theories written about 90% top marginal rates. In the real world, the last time we cut taxes on the rich, about 15 years ago, it was anything but good for the economy. &gt; If you want to be fair, then everyone should pay the same tax amount. Everyone knows there's a flat 10% federal tax in the US. and States can choose their own tax rate (I wonder where everyone would go).Setting aside the idea that a regressive tax system, like a flat tax is "fair," I have a question: Name one country currently using a flat income tax that you'd rather live in than America? Our tax system isn't perfect, but I'll argue any day it beats any place you can live with flat income tax.&gt; High taxes and over regulation results in business owners taking their operations to places where it's cheaper to do so.Depends on the regulation. American manufacturing moved overseas, not just because of taxes, they moved over seas b/c they were able to buy our government and keep their American tax subsidies while removing tariffs on importing their newly made foreign goods. They were able to get that done because unions are so decimated here. Countries like Germany can keep manufacturing such a high % of GDP b/c they have much higher union membership and a better regulatory environment. Parroting that taxes and regulation are bad misses a ton of the full picture. But again, that's how talking points work. They want you repeating the same simple argument. They want you focused on theory and not discussing what's happening empirically. It's "wealth trickles down as long as we don't stifle corporations with regulation." But if that were true, why did we not suffer one major crash after implementing Glass-Steagall, but have the worst downturn since the great depression within a decade of repealing it? That alone kills any anti-regulatory argument I've ever heard. Also, "regulation" gets lumped together as a rhetorical trick keep people from discussing anything specific. Not letting children work in factories, testing food to make sure it's safe to eat, not letting bosses demand sex from employees, not letting companies lie about what a product contains, requiring overtime pay after 40 hours, safe working conditions that don't endanger the life of workers... there are all "regulations" that workers had to fight, strike, and sometimes die for. Yeah, they inconvenience the companies, but I think they're pretty good ideas. Would you rather be a factory worker in New York or Shanghai? One has lots of progressive regulations, and one is an unregulated paradise. &gt; No government intervention needed.Ok, give me some examples of how life was better in America for workers before the New Deal imposed a fuck ton of regulations on business and created worker protection laws. Is there a single way workers were better off?&gt; Your Obamacare and mortgage examples. Like I said above:"Republicans have spent decades trying to break the federal government and then turn around and use the things THEY DO as proof that the government is bad. One party shuts tings down and our international credit rating goes down? Government's fault. One party ignores the empirical success of Keynesian economics and instead opts for more tax cuts on the rich, resulting in a smaller middle class? Government's fault. Then things got fun. Corporations worked really, really, REALLY had to ship good manufacturing jobs overseas. That coupled with spending billions to kill worker's rights at the state level, after decades of effort, resulted in a great win for them: they killed unions. There just weren't enough people in unions anymore to effectively fight for worker's rights. So, centrist democrats had to turn elsewhere for money, (which was Wall St. anti-union plan from day one).In the 90s, Wall St. bought Bill Clinton and now we had two parties working to fuck things up to make everyone hate the government. Let's deregulate Wall St., end welfare, and throw a bunch of black men in jail - said Bill Clinton and the whole Republican party...hey, isn't that a HUGE shock...things got worse for average Americans and WAY WAY better for the Ultra Rich? What a shock! Then George W Bush lowered taxes more on the rich, started two wars, and deregulated Wall St. even more...and, you're not going to believe this, things got worse for the 99%. Then Obama comes in, and decides, let me try the Republican health care plan from 1993...the one that does nothing but guarantee private companies more customers. I'm sure that'll fix things: spoiler alert...it didn't."My point is that both things you mentioned are perfect examples of what I'm saying. It's what happens when government is owned by the rich. Obamacare, a republican plan from the 90s gets passed forcing people into private insurance with no price caps. Wall St. buys congress and you get relaxed mortgage restrictions. For profit colleges lobby for looser restrictions and more tuition funding. Corporations bribe congressman to pass shitty laws that funnel money to them. That's the fundamental distinction between now and 70 years ago. In the wake of the new deal, we broke up monopolies, created a social safety net, and spent tons and tons of government money on building roads, bridges and buildings. And guess what? It was the high point of middle class American wealth. What a shock. Spending money to pay directly on public works projects is good for the economy. Funneling money into private companies isn't. What you're missing with your examples is that every problem you listed was *already* happening before the government interventions you blame. Insurance rates were already increasing rapidly. Tuition was already increasing rapidly. The home market was already stagnating. In every one of these cases the government chose the non-progressive option: funnel money to private companies. They didn't go with single payer health care. They didn't make public college free. They didn't stop investment banks from owning federally insured commercial bank loans. Your examples of bad government intervention are EXACTLY my point. When government does what Wall St. wants, we get fucked. $$$$$Here is the post for archival purposes:  **Author**:  _CarlCarpenter_  **Content**:   &gt;fied before congress about Benghazi, she mentioned twice there was a SCIF built into her home so she can securely communicate with the White House.&gt;A SCIF is a **Sensitive Complemented Information Facility&lt;/strong&gt;.&gt;How could the administration security experts build her a SCIF (designed for secured electronic communications) and NOT know that her communications system was unsecured and used a private server and not a secured government server?&gt;There had to be special permission given.&gt;I know this isn't a huge smoking gun, but it's a starting point.

It's a privately held company. It's not traded on Wall St. and it doesn't have share holders. It's owners can run the company how they want, and like most independent business owners, they run it ethically and responsibly. In contrast to that, you have burger king. A publically traded company run by Wall St number crunchers. So, it's not a shock that they pay their workers the legal minimum, or damn close to it. This is why regulation exists. Not because *all* companies are bad. But because whenever a company is run based purely on its bottom line, which almost all publically traded companies are, then worker protections are needed. We clearly disagree on the theory. So, let's have a non-theoretical conversation. I've given you, across several posts, my two main arguments. 1. Life in America was better after the New Deal than before and that as we've taken the New Deal apart in the last few decades, life has gotten worse for the median American household. Wages are stagnant, they have less political power, and they have a smaller share of total wealth. Things have gotten worse as we've adopted a fucked up combination of supply side economics, naked corporate hand outs, and deregulation. So if we're not employing progressive policies now, and things are bad, maybe progressive policies are worth a shot?  2. I'm willing to defend the idea that life is better economically for a child born today in any of the western European counties I've mentioned. If you disagree, pick any one, and I'll gladly defend it vs the US. $$$$$It's interesting to note that it is pretty widely reported that he forced his last LtGov after she broke with him on RFRA.

It *is* a class issue, but I don't think it's intended to be evil.  I think most of the problems we see have everything to do with selfish myopic perspectives.  If your average Congressman is a millionaire, of *course* their perceived solutions are going to be absolutely batshit stupid and insane (they *feel* they're average).We get driven by wedge issues when the biggest problem, the areas that require the most scrutiny, go ignored.  It's why Hillary being seen as the "most liberal Senator" makes no sense, because she's really not liberal in the *places that affect most Americans and where it counts*.And then, to stay in power, when making enough deals to get there, you eventually have to lie and be a general horrible individual.That's the weird thing about Trump.  You already KNOW he's a cheat, a horrible man.  But he doesn't hide that.With the rest of the establishment, they try to *hide* that they're cheats, so on top of all of that they're liars.This was apparent during the Primaries.

The computer scientists believe there was one logical conclusion to be drawn: The Trump Organization shut down the server after Alfa was told that the Times might expose the connection.

A progressive Supreme court majority is also very important, I don't want the US to be  set back 50 years socially because people are holding grudges.

Did you ever stop and think that maybe Sanders did not and does not appeal to most minority groups?$$$$$I think whoever wins well be just as divided as during the bush years.$$$$$Baby steps. Baby Steps$$$$$&gt; McCainKasich really admires John McCain and has for years.$$$$$[removed]$$$$$&gt; An article written in June about the first case that was already thrown out is your response after all that.From my understanding it was thrown out because the California address she listed wasn't valid. It should also be noted she tried to file the case herself without an attorney (not too smart). They refiled the case again in NY with new witnesses.  &gt;Which part of the article should I be focusing on here because I don't actual see anything that holds.  Are you for real? How about you start with the numbered points that explain in detail why the case should be taken seriously??? Here's one of the more important ones.   &gt;Two unusual documents are attached to Jane Does complaints - sworn declarations attesting to the facts. The first is from Jane Doe herself, telling her horrific story, including the allegation that Jeffrey Epstein also raped her and threatened her into silence, and this stunner:  *Defendant Epstein then attempted to strike me about the head with his closed fists while he angrily screamed at me that he, Defendant Epstein, should have been the one who took my virginity, not Defendant Trump . . .*  And this one:  *Defendant Trump stated that I shouldnt ever say anything if I didnt want to disappear like Maria, a 12-year-old female that was forced to be involved in the third incident with Defendant Trump and that I had not seen since that third incident, and that he was capable of having my whole family killed.*  The second declaration is even more astonishing, because it is signed by Tiffany Doe, Mr. Epsteins party planner from 1991-2000. Tiffany Doe says that her duties were to get attractive adolescent women to attend these parties. (Adolescents are, legally, children.  Tiffany Doe says that she recruited Jane Doe at the Port Authority in New York, persuaded her to attend Mr. Epsteins parties, and actually witnessed the sexual assaults on Jane Doe:  *I personally witnessed the Plaintiff being forced to perform various sexual acts with Donald J. Trump and Mr. Epstein. Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Epstein were advised that she was 13 years old.*  It is exceedingly rare for a sexual assault victim to have a witness. But Tiffany Doe says:  *I personally witnessed four sexual encounters that the Plaintiff was forced to have with Mr. Trump during this period, including the fourth of these encounters where Mr. Trump forcibly raped her despite her pleas to stop.*  Tiffany Doe corroborates, based on her own personal observations, just about everything in Jane Does complaint: that twelve year old Maria was involved in a sex act with Mr. Trump, that Mr. Trump threatened the life of Jane Doe if she ever revealed what happened, and that she would disappear like Maria if she did.  Tiffany Doe herself says that she is in mortal fear of Mr. Trump to this day:*I am coming forward to swear to the truthfulness of the physical and sexual abuse that I personally witnessed of minor females at the hands of Mr. Trump and Mr. Epstein . . . I swear to these facts under the penalty for perjury even though I fully understand that the life of myself and my family is now in grave danger.*   Given all this, and based on the record thus far, Jane Does claims appear credible. Mr. Epsteins own sexual crimes and parties with underage girls are well documented, as is Mr. Trumps relationship with him two decades ago in New York City. Mr. Trump told a reporter a few years ago: Ive known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy. Hes a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it, Jeffrey enjoys his social life.$$$$$Bang up job with the ad hominem there. Care to actually read the substance? I'll quote it again for you: &gt;When they take their vows and assume office, senior officials in the Justice Department and the FBI become part of these traditions, with an obligation to preserve, protect and defend them. They enjoy a credibility established by generations of honorable public servants, and they owe a solemn obligation to maintain that credibility. They are not to arrogate to themselves the choices made by the Justice Department and honored over the years.&gt;As part of that obligation, they must recognize that the department is an institution, not a person. As its temporary custodians, they must neither seek the spotlight for their own advancement nor avoid accountability for the hard decisions they inevitably face. Justice allows neither for self-aggrandizing crusaders on high horses nor for passive bureaucrats wielding rubber stamps from the shadows. It demands both humility and responsibility.Comey absolutely violated these values, and by his own admission has thought it was improper to violate the 60 day rule, except this one time [source 1] (http://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/31/fbis-comey-opposed-naming-russians-citing-election-timing-source.html)[source 2] (http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_5817b25de4b064e1b4b456f4)$$$$$I didn't say it was proof I said it was evidence.

A nation accruing debt is not such a bad thing: our debtors will undoubtedly wish to be paid eventually (read: China, etc). , but the success of our economy is the success of their economy as well. For example: we may issue gov't bonds to China which generate annual interest and we have to pay them back, eventually, but the money we make from the sale of those bonds funds US programs that help keep our economy running. Unsurprisingly enough, China's largest importer of their goods is none other than the US of A. So with this relationship, do you really feel like it's in China's best interest to collapse our economy by collecting on their investments all at once? Probably not. It would tank the global economy and specifically their own. As for Canada's HC system, I've read that while some folks prefer to go to the US for faster treatment, it's only the uber wealthy who do it bc they have the money and they're impatient. Nearly 2/3 of Canadians are satisfied with their HC, while nearly 2/3 of the US are Dissatisfied with their HC. http://www.gallup.com/poll/8056/healthcare-system-ratings-us-great-britain-canada.aspxAlso: if you're curious, in 2015 the US brought in 3.2 Trillion dollars in tax revenue. Our GDP is 5x that amount. By any way you measure it, we are the wealthiest nation ever to exist. In my perfect system, we would allocate some of this revenue to universal HC bc it should be a human right to treatment if you get sick. Last, UHC is not communism. Communism is when all capital is pooled together and distributed evenly among the masses regardless of work or value. UHC is simply fixing a broken system where a broken leg is price-gauged to oblivion and back bc someone who has stock in MRI machines wants a new yacht in Connecticut and they have a monopoly on the market so they can charge such rates. It's a broken, corrupt, and worst morally bankrupt system that the Public Option would fix once and for all.$$$$$This submission has been automatically removed because it comes from a domain that has been filtered for rehosted content.

Where did you even get that from. You're playing a game of telephone among clowns, and Obama didnt get involved at all. She stepped down because of political optics. Dems wanted to unify the party, and vocal minority was holding a gun to her head. At that point the best option is to sweep her away regardless of how she actually behaved. It was pure bullying. Obama did not tell her to go away, the whole party said on the eve of the convention let's clean this frenzy up as quick as possible, and that was it.$$$$$The only part of the election that is open to everyone are the general elections. We don't even need primaries. The DNC has decided to have primaries by their own volition and their own rules to vet who they think will be their best representative. Nothing shady about that. Sanders could've run independently or started a new party, but he chose to register as a democrat at the last minute and then run in the DNC primaries. Of course he would be vetted by that system, so not just anyone can seize the mantle of the party (ahem, Trump). He knew that, he took a chance, he made quite a bit of progress in the party platform, and he accepted the outcome. The reason I asked if you are a Sanders supporter is because I want to know why you no longer support him or trust his judgment?$$$$$[deleted]$$$$$I've posted stuff to back up my argument. You've yet to post anything, please be my guest.$$$$$&gt;In 2005, a group of Republican senators led by Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, responding to the Democrats' threat to filibuster some judicial nominees of President George W. Bush to prevent a vote on the nominations, floated the idea of having Vice President Dick Cheney, as President of the Senate, rule from the chair that a filibuster on judicial nominees was inconsistent with the constitutional grant of power to the president to name judges with the advice and consent of the SenateOh the irony.$$$$$Well now we are just going to disagree... and that's ok.  Here's my point- Trump is not a republican.  He uses the platform because he understands SOME of his beliefs (see the Wall) identify with a GOP backing.  Other beliefs he holds (see regulation and legalization of MMJ) are more liberal beliefs.  Trump is just using the GOP as a spring board, and that is what I love.  I do not consider myself a republican by the standard definition.  I identify as a RINO or Rockafellar Republican, which is more of what Trump is.  Trump is smart.  He says things to get the motivated hard core right riled up, and it works, they are voting in droves.  Folks like me like him more because he is common sense.  He doesn't support the idiotic BLM movement, he doesn't support taking in tons of wartorn muslim immigrants, he supports tearing down state boarders for health care, etc...  Look at his policies, they are all over the place.  He's not left, he's not right.  I like that.  To me that is common sense.Now... is he a flawless human?  No.  Has he done illegal things in his business dealings?  Probably.  Do those illegal things hold a candle to what HRC has done?  Absolutely not.  HRC left Americans to die in Benghazi.  HRC rigged an election against Bernie.  HRC gave US uranium to Russia, while blaming Russia for going against her in the election.  HRC gave a multi million dollar contract to her brother so he could profit all govt aid in Haiti post earthquake.  Those are major transgressions.  Forget the email thing- let's just say she's bad with computers.  Whats disturbing is the massive, and proven, pay for play operation she had with the Clinton Foundation.  Imagine what she'll do with that power if she's president.$$$$$[Here is the link to the original comment thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5ag1kt/breaking_real_footage_regarding_the_surge_of_new/" data-event-action="comments) Or you can comment here to start a discussion. **Author**:  _WigwamTeepee_$$$$$????

We *know* there are people who are petty and vindictive, and who have acted on it.  So there is no real reason to assume that stupidity is the *only* reason something happens when someone acting out of malice is also likely.There's malice and then there's *malice*.  The idea that someone, somewhere would actually set up a situation that would lead to people getting killed for political points is too repugnant to think about, even for me.  But I *can* see someone, intentionally, with malice aforethought, lie about receiving an order they didn't actually get, because it makes a person that individual doesn't support, politically, look bad.Politics is core to many people's personality.  Not just politicians, but regular folks too.  If given the opportunity to lash out against an "enemy" political movement or candidate that they don't like, even if it means lying about something to do so, many (not all, not even *most*) would do so in a heart beat.$$$$$This submission has been automatically removed because it comes from a domain that has been filtered for rehosted content.

And if that is that is the sentiment, I'm not too sure what to tell you, or what I should do even, other than to say I disagree. Black folk have been here more or less as long as white folk. I can recognize the role that IDpol has played in advancing the interests of historically marginalized peoples. Political strength comes from unity and organization of large groups of people, and while labour had unions, what did women specifically have, or Hispanics specifically have? So IDpol is maybe the natural outgrowth of that, but I can also see how the solidification of black identity or gay identity is being responded to by the reactionary formation of men's rights groups and now white identity groups. I don't think it's the job of a black organization, which is struggling against the marginalization of black people, to make space or whatever to white people, since the whole point was entry into the white space of society at large but I struggle to fully understand where to start with the problem of this reaction. I read an article today that definitely bares on this, and kind of crystallizes the nature of the problem at bit (I'll link below). Foucault was kind of the guy that introduced this idea of power relationship, and privilege within society that has been vulgarized into the lexicon of the left today, but it was pointed out that what has happened is that as this has entered into the discourse on the left fighting 'power' has replaced 'exploitation' which has lead to IDpol replacing class struggle as the primary political battle ground. Historically the left (forget particular parties or whatever) is the political orientation of those partisan to the working class, but Foucault's work drew attention to the marginalized in society, even from the bulk of the working class, groups which has been historically neglected within leftist thought. Groups like prostitutes, beggars, the insane or otherwise institutionalized, criminals, chronically unemployed, gays and transgendered people, and racial minorities etc.  But he didn't just draw attention and expanded the leftist mind to include these people. Rather he shifted the subject of his political ontology *from* the working class *to* these marginal types, and wrote about the institutions, cultural practises, and even language usage that maintains their marginalization. By doing this he essentially split the bottom whatever percent into the marginal and the 'privileged' working section of the class, and thus whether intentionally or not he pit the marginal and partisans of the marginal against the privileged section of the working class. The inverse of that is exactly what the mainstream right began to do; pit workers against the marginal elements of society (undocumented workers, immigrants, LGBT people, racial minorities, religious minorities) and cast those people as being the enemy of all the things they want. The protected, coddled, 'welfare queens' etc. Whatever can build resentment towards those who have less. When ultimately at the end of the day the bad guys are the folks at the top, the elite, which despite being something that many on both sides agree about, the GOP has made their people scared that the gain that the Dems provide for racial minorities or whatever other marginal people come at their expense, and the Dems scare their people that the GOP want to take away these social gains, all the while both operating not wholly dissimilar economic policy that help one section or another of big business. https://www.jacobinmag.com/2014/12/foucault-interview/$$$$$Neither do any of the people accusing her of corruption, HEYO!$$$$$Buckle up, buckaroos.$$$$$Yeah...that's all that's wrong with this woman.$$$$$What evidence do you have that 'presumably' all.elections have this issue?$$$$$[Here is the link to the original comment thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5ag1ct/trump_jr_rt_dineshdsouza_the_attorney_general/" data-event-action="comments) Or you can comment here to start a discussion. **Author**:  _gameplayviewer_$$$$$&gt;We don't know what would have happened if she didn't receive the question prior to the debate.Again, we have extremely reasonable conclusions that can be drawn from history. Hillary Clinton made her stance on this question clear in the past, and specifically in the previous DNC primary she participated in back in 2008. Her stance has remained mostly unchanged since then.You're right that we don't know what would have happened, but only by the strictest and most technical definition of what you're saying, which is in and of itself a fairly unreasonable thing to say. It's not unreasonable to speculate about things where evidence or data exists to support speculations. Those things exist in regards to how Hillary Clinton would have answered the question with or without prior knowledge of the question. Those things *do not* exist regarding why she was given the question in the first place.&gt;and it's wrong for you to say that it wouldn't have mattered anyway when it has clearly done so.Again, I've seen precisely zero evidence supporting your claim that it would have mattered, but I see a lot of evidence that says it wouldn't.

(TL:DR: i dont think the emails or the FBI comments mean shit, nobody is switching sides at this stage, even though i believe the DNC knew this could be an issue and took a risk.... tldr first for convenience.)Around the world we on the news we saw Bernie explode near the end, seemingly out of nowhere (the big international news channels didnt cover him much at all until it was vitually impossible not to)On reddit we saw an exaggeration of his popularity, here he was bigger than Trump and Clinton combined (not sure if Bernie fans were more vocal then because he had a chance, or if they switched to Hillary after). Im not sure if you remember but he could do no wrong here on reddit (kinda like how reddit treats Clinton now). Even Trump supporters posted more on reddit then (not sure if they get Down voted out of existence now or if even they gave up on Trump or perhaps they stopped leaving the safety of the Donald Sub)Enough reflection  though, my point is we all knew it was risky for the DNC to run with Clinton, i wish i took screen shots of all the times i read on reddit that Bernie had the best chance of Beating Trump. For a a while after the DNC chose Hillary the Bernie fans here Scolded the DNC and even accused them of rigging the primaries cheating Sanders out.Now as a non-American we've watched the polarization of the last legs of the race, Spin is dominating this election on both side, on reddit we mainly see one side people are passionate about the Anyone but Trump agenda, on facebook we can still see the pro Trump agenda pushed  and it is even more redicules.Now, From what ive seen from the mainstream, reddit and facebook it looks to be already Hilary by a landslide but i guess Trump supporters arent as present in my general online browsing.The main thing Ive taken from this election is that Sentiment and Fear is far more powerful politically than hope and that regardless of the indicators, history, hypocrisy and blatant spin...people have already chosen whichever candidate they want. People are as biased and each campeigns spin, as biased mainstream media that panders to one side or the other. These emails are irrelevent to this election. How many of you have switched sides. If people who have switched side because of the emails would kindly comment i would like to see a glimpse what kind of numbers are out there.If you are a clinton fan and sticking strong after the emails upvote, if you are a Bernie fan and you are just waiting for a second chance for him to be president, Downvote.Edit: if anybody knows a way to make a proper poll on reddit please teach me, the way im running it now leaves a bad tast in my mouth...its all too "facebooky"$$$$$[Here is the link to the original comment thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5ag19z/clinton_abandons_pivot_to_positive_campaign/" data-event-action="comments) Or you can comment here to start a discussion. **Author**:  _Manafort_$$$$$With a Trump victory there goes the senate to the GOP, and the GOP maintaining the house.

While I obviously agree that proportional representation is far superior and more friendly to third parties, what I'm talking about has more to do with overarching policy and the general political environment.The mere existence of a strong third party has had a major structural effect on Canadian politics. The history of the liberal party is defined by the kinds of moves made during the last election, one the main reasons they've lasted so long and formed so many governments. If the vote can be split along more granular lines than 'right and left' it creates the need to co opt policies to prevent support moving towards the more responsive party. With electoral support pretty much locked in through a broad binary, policy logically only remains responsive to donors and other powerful groups. The real difference in democrat and republican policy is reflected in what sector of the US plutocratic class has backed a given side. (Canada is of course not totally immune to this)Yes, the downside is that involvement from more than 2 parties increases the distortion between the actual make up of Parliament and the popular vote but the actual policies pushed forward by the dominant bloc have a tendency by necessity to be more representative. $$$$$[deleted]$$$$$But in all seriousness I feel really bad for Jeb$$$$$What will you say if it turns out this is true?$$$$$Why is anyone who opposes your POV a shill?

Essentially 4 more years of Obama. You just need a blue congress.This is why virtually every Country except Russia prefers her.This whole BoB shit is incredibly selfish, ignorant and the epitome of privilege.But hey, after Trump turned the US into a giant Kansas, after he threw the world into another Great Depression, after he commited countless war crimes, after he made the SCOTUS conservative for decades, after Pence and the GOP got their Christian Sharia and rolled back all liberal progress of the last decades, after Nazism and White surpremacism became the leader of the free world, you can still say to yourself: 'I traded my Future for facebook likes.'$$$$$[deleted]$$$$$[deleted]$$$$$In this case being tardy = releasing an October surprise during a vulnerable time in the electionStupidly breaking protocol = it wasn't actually breaking protocol, according to the WH that said Comey was acting with integrity$$$$$Your question is fallacious.$$$$$LMFAO.

I mean, when else in America's history has gay marriage been legal? I mean, at what point in history was America more liberal than today? 1960? Interracial marriage wasn't even legal until 1968. Racism and sexism certainly haven't been solved, but it is a whole lot better today than the 60's. Women today make $0.8 on the dollar, but that was a whole lot better than it was 50 years ago. Blacks and Hispanics have been the biggest gainers in the last 50 years and they are still disadvantaged in today's world. Imagine how disadvantaged they were 50 years ago.$$$$$There's no way Barron would do a mistake like this.$$$$$The world cannot afford kids.$$$$$Trump also spoke at Value Voters Summit while they handed out anti gay pamphlets. That's also the organization that worked to pass laws to execute gays in Africa. The GOP platform that Trump supports includes conversion therapy (mental and physical abuse) for kids. Support Trump if you want but fo not lie about his outrageously anti gay campaign and platform.$$$$$It's really not though. I voted for Clinton (early voting in my state) and I still see that plenty of what she's done is ethically questionable and wrong - I just *still* think she's better than Trump and know that one of the two of them is going to win. I know people are sick of the email thing and I am too, but having a secret email server while *knowing* that you aren't supposed to is *clearly* ethically wrong and I don't see how anyone can dispute that. Running a foundation that accepts donations from foreign officials while acting as the secretary of state is *clearly* ethically wrong and I don't see how it's possible to dispute that either. Hiring the director of the DNC after she was ousted for propping up your campaign at the expense of another democratic candidate - clearly ethically questionable *at best*. Pretending that this isn't a person who is OK with doing ethically questionable or wrong things to get ahead is just pulling the wool over your eyes.e: And did you just forget about the article whose thread we're in?

A tea-party republican was infused with a ton of outsider money from outside MA in the dead of winter during the holidays in an off-season special election held in January to replace TED KENNEDY'S senate seat, and won because of it. I'm not saying Democracy was subverted, but that guy would not have won in ANY other circumstance, and sure enough when a normal election was held, he was trounced easily in 2014. He was a shitty politician plain and simple, but he did the dirty work for the Republicans during his short stint in the Senate so he's got that going for him, which is nice. /sMy point being: if Ted Kennedy hadn't of died, or if a normal election were held, we likely would have a Public Option or Single Payer system of HC were if not for Scott Brown.$$$$$How can you say evolution is a fact?

But, I can't explain this to you it is multi-dimension problem.I will try though.Exit-polls are accurate because they sample the population. Actual voters. Pre-voting polls do not sample actual voters. They through various means attempt to sample "likely voters."  So get out a piece of paper and draw a coordinate system with "actual voters" in the center. And then throw a couple of darts at it to get a representative sample of "likely voters."  All pre-voting polls do just this. Now, some polls target only a subsection of "likely voters" those you are calling "biased."  Some, have low numbers or other problems, those you are calling poor quality, but no polls are centered on "Actual voters" unless by pure chance your dart hit the center.The "Sampling" error reported is about the dart hole. NOT about the position of the "Actual voter."So when you average the polls, what they are doing is converting this 2-dimensional sheet and aligning all the holes on top of each other. You can weight the sampling from that coninciding point all you want the actual error is still that whole sheet. Beyond the "likely" vs. "actual" voter issues you have the cognitive bias of the "survey effect."  Unless all polls ask the same questions, in the same manner and tone, this "survey error" will be different and is BEYOND the sampling error reported. And I am not talking about the "House Effect."  https://www.amazon.com/Psychology-Survey-Response-Roger-Tourangeau/dp/0521576296It has been found that just by surveying people you get skewed results. And, each poll skews in different ways. There is a Machine Learning Group that is getting good data. It is AI something and is using Twitter. It is not surveying or polling and it is sampling millions of users to determine who actually will vote and what their vote will be.EDIT: I realize there is a slight error in this example but honestly I have no way of explaining this as it is a multi-dimensional error problem.$$$$$Pretty much every Republican Presidential candidate from this year except for Chris Christie (who is fortunately also against LGBT employment discrimination and supports anti-bullying laws as well) approves of gay conversion therapy.$$$$$So the amount of people trying to change their vote looks to have doubled since last cycle.

To be clear, I'm not saying Trump himself is guilty of treason, but members of his camp could be depending on how deep this goes. Now to be clear, treason by the U.S. definition only consists of two things: levying war against our country, or adhering to our enemies, giving them aid and comfort.If members of Trump's campaign have been working directly with a foreign government to disrupt our democratic system and elect someone of their choosing as president, I'd argue that that is aiding and adhering to our enemies.$$$$$I don't have any trouble imagining them as being hired and tutored by the most famous conservative organization(s) in our nation, the same organization that has never found a political lie or trick to big or too destructive to the entire electorate to use.$$$$$If this is true it would  be the biggest scandal the United States has ever seen. For that reason I'm extremely hesitant to believe it.$$$$$I'm sorry introduce a little rhyme and reason into your world but here I go.  First, do you think they ever would have let him run as a D if he didn't agree in the first place to endorse the eventual winner?  Not a chance in hell! Don't forget, the Democratic party is a club and they decide who gets to play in their clubhouse.  Sure, many arguments can be made about the primary but he made a commitment, and one of the reasons we all love him is because he is a man of his word.  Second, do you think they would have let him keep his seniority on any of his committees if he hadn't endorsed her?  NOT. A. FUCKING. CHANCE!!!  He is on 8 committees and would have been booted from them all.  He is in line to be the head of the budgetary committee, you know, where they craft the US budget.  There is also the potential for him to head the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee. You know, where things like single payer healthcare is covered.  Had he not endorsed her he would be sitting at home on the couch with his grandkids. If you've studied his career at all, he is about policy first and foremost.  Given he was the Amendment King in both the house and senate can you trust he may actually know how to get things done?  He only loses if people go back to being complacent whiners who can't see the big picture. By endorsing Hillary he lives to continue to fight for his progressive ideas. As Bernie has pointed out too many times to count, under Trump, everything we all fought for would be DEAD.  Under Clinton, he will be a progressive pain in her ass who can still mobilize his base.  Just look how much money he raised about a week and a half ago...2 million dollars for down ballot progressives!  He's already come out and stated his plans to keep her feet to the fire on all the things she stated publicly she supported. BTW, what the hell promise did he not keep?  He always said from the beginning he was never going to run third party.  I don't think he ever actually promised he was going to win, just try his absolute best.  Any of his "supporters" who piss and moan because he is continuing to work in the system, weren't paying attention in the first place.$$$$$[deleted]$$$$$You know, I have no problem with religion at all, except when it's used to systematically blind people from real life facts that are true.

And the best way he could do this was showing that they were also investigating the Clinton campaign. But also consider this.  Any charges that would come out of the Russia/Trump investigation would happen after the election.  The smart money has been on Hillary, at least since the debates, and it's a pretty un-American thing -- and a terrible precedent -- for one president to pursue charges on the person they just defeated in the election.
