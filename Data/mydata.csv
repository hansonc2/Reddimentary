She demonstrated that she lacks basic good judgement, actually she has demonstrated very poor judgement.  Anyone that doesn't believe that her actions were less than careless has to been the most die hard and devoted of Hillary supporters.

Your imagination seem to have no boundaries as I am sure you will be hard pressed to show where I have gone out of my way to praise Comey, like I said, I thought the result was wrong.

I am pretty sure Bill gets called dishonest as much as Hillary.  Why do you want to turn this into a sexist thing when I have not inferred anything sexist, implied anything  sexist nor said anything that could be sanely construed as sexist.  Methinks you  doth protest to much.

You belong to the delusional core that believes in Hillary's magic wand, you know the one she uses when she wants ""to get things done"".  A wand of unlimited power that causes the Republicans to put off their impeachment hearings (you know they are coming if the House stays Republican) and instead work with the politician that they hate and want to see fail even more than Obama.  If you actually wanted results you would have worked for one of the other Democratic candidates that were running.  Hillary has no history of ""getting things done"", it is simply a myth.

When money influences policy that is corruption.  It may not be the legal definition but it certainly meets the moral definition  in my book.

Well, let's break it down and see.  Here is the comment you originally replied to:

&gt;Oh and those darn Bernie supporters, turned out they were right about the DNC scheming against Sanders. Who would have thought?!

So this comment is talking about the scheming that the DNC did against Sanders.  To which you replied:

&gt;It's almost as if they didn't want someone who'd never done significant fundraising for them in the past to use all their money.

Looking at this response in context of the comment it is responding to, there is no other way to interpret it's meaning other than it is giving justification for the action in the first comment which is 'DNC scheming against Sanders.'  You don't refute or deny the DNC schemed and in-fact give justification for it which is, '...they didn't want someone who'd never done significant fundraising for them in the past to use all their money.'

Your response says nothing of any positive/negative impact on the People and only indicates a concern for who gets to spend the Democratic party's money.  It's also said in a manner as if it's obvious or acceptable for them to scheme against another candidate and this is only emphasized by your little 'Craaaazzzyyyyyy' at the end.  

So to answer your question, no, there is no way I misunderstood what you said.  Now if what you said is not what you meant, that's not my fault for misunderstanding.  That's your fault for writing poorly and misrepresenting yourself.  

If what you said is what you meant, then you care more about the party than you do the People.  Since you are justifying the DNC corruptly favoring a known liar--that being Hillary, just in-case it wasn't clear--over doing what they are supposed to be doing, which is be impartial to all Democratic candidates regardless where they came from before.

Therefore, learning from you, I went through your history, and what I found is that around every other posts or comments you made, are involving calling others ""nazis"", ""antisemetic"", ""conspiracy"", etc, and you are accusing me of a single comment I made yrs ago being so called ""antisemetic"", then what does your doing makes of you? A even bigger tinfoil hat?The Like I said before, you are nothing but a conspiracy believer yourself, like the imaginary counterparts you want to fight. Truly pathetic for this morbid obsession. Sad! In the end, before I block you and your nonintellectual and unhealthy thoughts, here is something I want you to read. It's from German philosopher Nietzsche, which I hope that didn't trigger your paranormal mind, ""He who fights with monsters should be careful lest he thereby become a monster.

politics,t5_2cneq,genebeam,1,FALSE,t3_5aeecy,"An attempt at a theory of what's going on:

The FBI is pursuing the Russia investigation and some serious charges are coming against Trump or people in his campaign. It's going to be a bombshell and people are going to prison, stuff like that. Because of the national security implications this investigation is being held closer to the chest; a lot fewer people internally know about it so they can better control leaks.

Comey and the FBI have been heavily criticized for not recommending charges against Clinton in July. If that was followed up with bringing down the hammer on Trump there'd be tremendous partisan backlash. ""Comey's in the pocket of the Clintons and sending their enemies to jail"", etc. Comey perceives this and worries the FBI will be seen as a partisan actor. There's tremendous pressure and that's manifested as this sloppy decision to announce the investigation of more emails of Clinton's. Comey knows it looks like shit but thinks it will provide some insulation to the coming bombshell, which is the important thing.

The really motivated bias in the mainstream media outside Fox is not toward one ideology or another; it's toward ratings and ad dollars. That means they have to try not to piss off either side too badly. And that means trying to give a roughly equal amount of positive and negative coverage to either side, to achieve ""balance"" instead of fairness. When the quality of the candidates is grossly imbalanced, any push toward balance is effectively a bias in favor of the worst candidate. 

I would argue that unbiased reporting should forget about balance and instead focus on holding candidates to the same standard. That is, any statement or action should be judged by the same standards regardless of which candidate made it. By this standard, the entire media--including MSNBC--has been grossly biased toward Trump, even if they have much more negative coverage of him overall. That's because they let Trump get away with saying dozens of things every day that would sink Hillary Clinton's or anyone else's campaign. His entire stump speech is more incoherent than Rick Perry's ""oops"" moment, but nobody bats an eye.

How long you live, the purchasing power of your salary, bankruptcy due to illness, median household income, etc. I'm not saying any have it *all* figured out, just that they can somehow have universal health care without collapsing, why can't we?

&gt; Questions, Not a conservative ""talking point"".

LOL, come on man. Be serious. I told you where the money would come from several posts ago. Taxes. You're just trained to keep asking the question even after the answer has been given. That's the definition of a talking point. 

&gt; Your economics are flawed though... Money that sits in savings, and funds are inserted back into the economy in a **far more productive manner** than just passing it out to poor people through social services.

Really? We have more money sitting in savings and investments now than any time in history...how are we doing economically? Seriously. I'd love to learn how Keynesian economics *didn't* get us out of the great depression. Poor people don't have discretionary income. They spend everything they have to live. That money goes right back into the economy. 100% of a wage increase given to a poor worker goes back into the consumer economy. They don't save, b/c they still have basic needs unmet. On the other hand, money given to a millionaire gets saved. Sure, that money can then be lent out, but what company takes out a loan if they don't have people buying their goods? Companies don't hire more workers because they have more money, they hire more workers when they *have* to. When there's enough demand for your goods or services and your current operation can't fulfill it all, *then* you hire more workers. You don't just do it b/c you got more money. 

Also, My point is that the super rich don't just save in banks, they save in off-shore, untaxed shell companies. They literally take money out of the economy. They take it an put it overseas, and don't pay taxes on it. If you're curious how much they do this, check out any of the reporting about the panama papers. Your argument is flawed in that it assumes an all or nothing approach. Just because we tax rich people more doesn't mean there won't be any savings anymore. It means there will be less at the top 1%, but that will be more than made up for by consumer spending. You've got the basic conservative talking points about supply-side economics down, but they're based on theories written about 90% top marginal rates. In the real world, the last time we cut taxes on the rich, about 15 years ago, it was anything but good for the economy. 


&gt; If you want to be fair, then everyone should pay the same tax amount.
 Everyone knows there's a flat 10% federal tax in the US. and States can choose their own tax rate (I wonder where everyone would go).

Setting aside the idea that a regressive tax system, like a flat tax is ""fair,"" I have a question: Name one country currently using a flat income tax that you'd rather live in than America? Our tax system isn't perfect, but I'll argue any day it beats any place you can live with flat income tax.

&gt; High taxes and over regulation results in business owners taking their operations to places where it's cheaper to do so.

Depends on the regulation. American manufacturing moved overseas, not just because of taxes, they moved over seas b/c they were able to buy our government and keep their American tax subsidies while removing tariffs on importing their newly made foreign goods. They were able to get that done because unions are so decimated here. Countries like Germany can keep manufacturing such a high % of GDP b/c they have much higher union membership and a better regulatory environment. Parroting that taxes and regulation are bad misses a ton of the full picture. But again, that's how talking points work. They want you repeating the same simple argument. They want you focused on theory and not discussing what's happening empirically. It's ""wealth trickles down as long as we don't stifle corporations with regulation."" But if that were true, why did we not suffer one major crash after implementing Glass-Steagall, but have the worst downturn since the great depression within a decade of repealing it? That alone kills any anti-regulatory argument I've ever heard. 

Also, ""regulation"" gets lumped together as a rhetorical trick keep people from discussing anything specific. Not letting children work in factories, testing food to make sure it's safe to eat, not letting bosses demand sex from employees, not letting companies lie about what a product contains, requiring overtime pay after 40 hours, safe working conditions that don't endanger the life of workers... there are all ""regulations"" that workers had to fight, strike, and sometimes die for. Yeah, they inconvenience the companies, but I think they're pretty good ideas. Would you rather be a factory worker in New York or Shanghai? One has lots of progressive regulations, and one is an unregulated paradise. 

&gt; No government intervention needed.

Ok, give me some examples of how life was better in America for workers before the New Deal imposed a fuck ton of regulations on business and created worker protection laws. Is there a single way workers were better off?

&gt; Your Obamacare and mortgage examples. 

Like I said above:

""Republicans have spent decades trying to break the federal government and then turn around and use the things THEY DO as proof that the government is bad. One party shuts tings down and our international credit rating goes down? Government's fault. One party ignores the empirical success of Keynesian economics and instead opts for more tax cuts on the rich, resulting in a smaller middle class? Government's fault. Then things got fun. Corporations worked really, really, REALLY had to ship good manufacturing jobs overseas. That coupled with spending billions to kill worker's rights at the state level, after decades of effort, resulted in a great win for them: they killed unions. There just weren't enough people in unions anymore to effectively fight for worker's rights. So, centrist democrats had to turn elsewhere for money, (which was Wall St. anti-union plan from day one).
In the 90s, Wall St. bought Bill Clinton and now we had two parties working to fuck things up to make everyone hate the government. Let's deregulate Wall St., end welfare, and throw a bunch of black men in jail - said Bill Clinton and the whole Republican party...hey, isn't that a HUGE shock...things got worse for average Americans and WAY WAY better for the Ultra Rich? What a shock! Then George W Bush lowered taxes more on the rich, started two wars, and deregulated Wall St. even more...and, you're not going to believe this, things got worse for the 99%. Then Obama comes in, and decides, let me try the Republican health care plan from 1993...the one that does nothing but guarantee private companies more customers. I'm sure that'll fix things: spoiler alert...it didn't.""

My point is that both things you mentioned are perfect examples of what I'm saying. It's what happens when government is owned by the rich. Obamacare, a republican plan from the 90s gets passed forcing people into private insurance with no price caps. Wall St. buys congress and you get relaxed mortgage restrictions. For profit colleges lobby for looser restrictions and more tuition funding. Corporations bribe congressman to pass shitty laws that funnel money to them. That's the fundamental distinction between now and 70 years ago. In the wake of the new deal, we broke up monopolies, created a social safety net, and spent tons and tons of government money on building roads, bridges and buildings. And guess what? It was the high point of middle class American wealth. What a shock. Spending money to pay directly on public works projects is good for the economy. Funneling money into private companies isn't. 

What you're missing with your examples is that every problem you listed was *already* happening before the government interventions you blame. Insurance rates were already increasing rapidly. Tuition was already increasing rapidly. The home market was already stagnating. In every one of these cases the government chose the non-progressive option: funnel money to private companies. They didn't go with single payer health care. They didn't make public college free. They didn't stop investment banks from owning federally insured commercial bank loans. Your examples of bad government intervention are EXACTLY my point. When government does what Wall St. wants, we get fucked.

In-N-Out is a really good example actually. It's a privately held company. It's not traded on Wall St. and it doesn't have share holders. It's owners can run the company how they want, and like most independent business owners, they run it ethically and responsibly. In contrast to that, you have burger king. A publically traded company run by Wall St number crunchers. So, it's not a shock that they pay their workers the legal minimum, or damn close to it. This is why regulation exists. Not because *all* companies are bad. But because whenever a company is run based purely on its bottom line, which almost all publically traded companies are, then worker protections are needed. 

We clearly disagree on the theory. So, let's have a non-theoretical conversation. I've given you, across several posts, my two main arguments. 1. Life in America was better after the New Deal than before and that as we've taken the New Deal apart in the last few decades, life has gotten worse for the median American household. Wages are stagnant, they have less political power, and they have a smaller share of total wealth. Things have gotten worse as we've adopted a fucked up combination of supply side economics, naked corporate hand outs, and deregulation. So if we're not employing progressive policies now, and things are bad, maybe progressive policies are worth a shot?  2. I'm willing to defend the idea that life is better economically for a child born today in any of the western European counties I've mentioned. If you disagree, pick any one, and I'll gladly defend it vs the US.

It *is* a class issue, but I don't think it's intended to be evil.  I think most of the problems we see have everything to do with selfish myopic perspectives.  If your average Congressman is a millionaire, of *course* their perceived solutions are going to be absolutely batshit stupid and insane (they *feel* they're average).

We get driven by wedge issues when the biggest problem, the areas that require the most scrutiny, go ignored.  It's why Hillary being seen as the ""most liberal Senator"" makes no sense, because she's really not liberal in the *places that affect most Americans and where it counts*.

And you doubt civil rights will be rolled back? You have any idea the crazy shit the Republican House wants to pass if they get a Republican president? Not talking about a ban on abortion but they can do everything in their power to make it difficult and humiliating for women they possibly can. And ""as an atheist"" I'm sure you're a fan of the ""religious freedom laws"" that have been passed by Mike Pence and others. Supreme Court upheld most of them in the Hobby Lobby case. And what about science? 8 years of Bush meant 8 years lost of stem cell research. What will Trump's EPA focus on, for example? He has already said he'd stop NASA from doing climate research. Trump has been pushing for ""school choice"" as his education plan. Do you think Trump would allow his Department of Education to write guidelines for banning government funds going to schools where creationism is taught? Cause our school choice bill in Louisiana led to that. Does he care enough to prevent it from happening? Cause my guess would be Mike Pence might have some influence in those kinds of decisions.

Or as it is technically diagnosed, it had “SERVFAILed.” (On the timeline above, this is the moment at the end of the chronology when the traffic abruptly spikes, as servers frantically attempt to resend rejected messages.) The computer scientists believe there was one logical conclusion to be drawn: The Trump Organization shut down the server after Alfa was told that the Times might expose the connection.

&gt;When they take their vows and assume office, senior officials in the Justice Department and the FBI become part of these traditions, with an obligation to preserve, protect and defend them. They enjoy a credibility established by generations of honorable public servants, and they owe a solemn obligation to maintain that credibility. They are not to arrogate to themselves the choices made by the Justice Department and honored over the years.

&gt;As part of that obligation, they must recognize that the department is an institution, not a person. As its temporary custodians, they must neither seek the spotlight for their own advancement nor avoid accountability for the hard decisions they inevitably face. Justice allows neither for self-aggrandizing crusaders on high horses nor for passive bureaucrats wielding rubber stamps from the shadows. It demands both humility and responsibility.

I think people confuse national debt with personal debt and get into an issue with it. A nation accruing debt is not such a bad thing: our debtors will undoubtedly wish to be paid eventually (read: China, etc). , but the success of our economy is the success of their economy as well. For example: we may issue gov't bonds to China which generate annual interest and we have to pay them back, eventually, but the money we make from the sale of those bonds funds US programs that help keep our economy running. Unsurprisingly enough, China's largest importer of their goods is none other than the US of A. So with this relationship, do you really feel like it's in China's best interest to collapse our economy by collecting on their investments all at once? Probably not. It would tank the global economy and specifically their own. 

As for Canada's HC system, I've read that while some folks prefer to go to the US for faster treatment, it's only the uber wealthy who do it bc they have the money and they're impatient. Nearly 2/3 of Canadians are satisfied with their HC, while nearly 2/3 of the US are Dissatisfied with their HC. 

http://www.gallup.com/poll/8056/healthcare-system-ratings-us-great-britain-canada.aspx

Also: if you're curious, in 2015 the US brought in 3.2 Trillion dollars in tax revenue. Our GDP is 5x that amount. By any way you measure it, we are the wealthiest nation ever to exist.

 In my perfect system, we would allocate some of this revenue to universal HC bc it should be a human right to treatment if you get sick. 

Last, UHC is not communism. Communism is when all capital is pooled together and distributed evenly among the masses regardless of work or value. UHC is simply fixing a broken system where a broken leg is price-gauged to oblivion and back bc someone who has stock in MRI machines wants a new yacht in Connecticut and they have a monopoly on the market so they can charge such rates. It's a broken, corrupt, and worst morally bankrupt system that the Public Option would fix once and for all.",0,1481097940,1477960580,d9g5n7b,0,t1_d9g4ml1,1477959222

He uses the platform because he understands SOME of his beliefs (see the Wall) identify with a GOP backing.  Other beliefs he holds (see regulation and legalization of MMJ) are more liberal beliefs.  Trump is just using the GOP as a spring board, and that is what I love.  I do not consider myself a republican by the standard definition.  I identify as a RINO or Rockafellar Republican, which is more of what Trump is.  Trump is smart.  He says things to get the motivated hard core right riled up, and it works, they are voting in droves.  Folks like me like him more because he is common sense.  He doesn't support the idiotic BLM movement, he doesn't support taking in tons of wartorn muslim immigrants, he supports tearing down state boarders for health care, etc...  Look at his policies, they are all over the place.  He's not left, he's not right.  I like that.  To me that is common sense.

HRC gave a multi million dollar contract to her brother so he could profit all govt aid in Haiti post earthquake.  Those are major transgressions.

And if that is that is the sentiment, I'm not too sure what to tell you, or what I should do even, other than to say I disagree. Black folk have been here more or less as long as white folk. 

I can recognize the role that IDpol has played in advancing the interests of historically marginalized peoples. Political strength comes from unity and organization of large groups of people, and while labour had unions, what did women specifically have, or Hispanics specifically have? So IDpol is maybe the natural outgrowth of that, but I can also see how the solidification of black identity or gay identity is being responded to by the reactionary formation of men's rights groups and now white identity groups. I don't think it's the job of a black organization, which is struggling against the marginalization of black people, to make space or whatever to white people, since the whole point was entry into the white space of society at large but I struggle to fully understand where to start with the problem of this reaction. 

I read an article today that definitely bares on this, and kind of crystallizes the nature of the problem at bit (I'll link below). Foucault was kind of the guy that introduced this idea of power relationship, and privilege within society that has been vulgarized into the lexicon of the left today, but it was pointed out that what has happened is that as this has entered into the discourse on the left fighting 'power' has replaced 'exploitation' which has lead to IDpol replacing class struggle as the primary political battle ground. Historically the left (forget particular parties or whatever) is the political orientation of those partisan to the working class, but Foucault's work drew attention to the marginalized in society, even from the bulk of the working class, groups which has been historically neglected within leftist thought. Groups like prostitutes, beggars, the insane or otherwise institutionalized, criminals, chronically unemployed, gays and transgendered people, and racial minorities etc.  But he didn't just draw attention and expanded the leftist mind to include these people. Rather he shifted the subject of his political ontology *from* the working class *to* these marginal types, and wrote about the institutions, cultural practises, and even language usage that maintains their marginalization. By doing this he essentially split the bottom whatever percent into the marginal and the 'privileged' working section of the class, and thus whether intentionally or not he pit the marginal and partisans of the marginal against the privileged section of the working class. The inverse of that is exactly what the mainstream right began to do; pit workers against the marginal elements of society (undocumented workers, immigrants, LGBT people, racial minorities, religious minorities) and cast those people as being the enemy of all the things they want. The protected, coddled, 'welfare queens' etc. Whatever can build resentment towards those who have less. When ultimately at the end of the day the bad guys are the folks at the top, the elite, which despite being something that many on both sides agree about, the GOP has made their people scared that the gain that the Dems provide for racial minorities or whatever other marginal people come at their expense, and the Dems scare their people that the GOP want to take away these social gains, all the while both operating not wholly dissimilar economic policy that help one section or another of big business.

Are you for real? How about you start with the numbered points that explain in detail why the case should be taken seriously??? Here's one of the more important ones.   

&gt;Two unusual documents are attached to Jane Doe’s complaints - sworn declarations attesting to the facts. The first is from Jane Doe herself, telling her horrific story, including the allegation that Jeffrey Epstein also raped her and threatened her into silence, and this stunner:  
*Defendant Epstein then attempted to strike me about the head with his closed fists while he angrily screamed at me that he, Defendant Epstein, should have been the one who took my virginity, not Defendant Trump . . .*  
And this one:  
*Defendant Trump stated that I shouldn’t ever say anything if I didn’t want to disappear like Maria, a 12-year-old female that was forced to be involved in the third incident with Defendant Trump and that I had not seen since that third incident, and that he was capable of having my whole family killed.*  
The second declaration is even more astonishing, because it is signed by “Tiffany Doe”, Mr. Epstein’s “party planner” from 1991-2000. Tiffany Doe says that her duties were “to get attractive adolescent women to attend these parties.” (Adolescents are, legally, children.  
Tiffany Doe says that she recruited Jane Doe at the Port Authority in New York, persuaded her to attend Mr. Epstein’s parties, and actually witnessed the sexual assaults on Jane Doe:  
*I personally witnessed the Plaintiff being forced to perform various sexual acts with Donald J. Trump and Mr. Epstein. Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Epstein were advised that she was 13 years old.*  
It is exceedingly rare for a sexual assault victim to have a witness. But Tiffany Doe says:  
*I personally witnessed four sexual encounters that the Plaintiff was forced to have with Mr. Trump during this period, including the fourth of these encounters where Mr. Trump forcibly raped her despite her pleas to stop.*  
Tiffany Doe corroborates, based on her own personal observations, just about everything in Jane Doe’s complaint: that twelve year old Maria was involved in a sex act with Mr. Trump, that Mr. Trump threatened the life of Jane Doe if she ever revealed what happened, and that she would “disappear” like Maria if she did.  
Tiffany Doe herself says that she is in mortal fear of Mr. Trump to this day:
*I am coming forward to swear to the truthfulness of the physical and sexual abuse that I personally witnessed of minor females at the hands of Mr. Trump and Mr. Epstein . . . I swear to these facts under the penalty for perjury even though I fully understand that the life of myself and my family is now in grave danger.*   
Given all this, and based on the record thus far, Jane Doe’s claims appear credible. Mr. Epstein’s own sexual crimes and parties with underage girls are well documented, as is Mr. Trump’s relationship with him two decades ago in New York City. Mr. Trump told a reporter a few years ago: “I’ve known Jeff for 15 years. Terrific guy. He’s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.

(TL:DR: i dont think the emails or the FBI comments mean shit, nobody is switching sides at this stage, even though i believe the DNC knew this could be an issue and took a risk.... tldr first for convenience.)


Around the world we on the news we saw Bernie explode near the end, seemingly out of nowhere (the big international news channels didnt cover him much at all until it was vitually impossible not to)

On reddit we saw an exaggeration of his popularity, here he was bigger than Trump and Clinton combined (not sure if Bernie fans were more vocal then because he had a chance, or if they switched to Hillary after).

 Im not sure if you remember but he could do no wrong here on reddit (kinda like how reddit treats Clinton now). 

Even Trump supporters posted more on reddit then (not sure if they get Down voted out of existence now or if even they gave up on Trump or perhaps they stopped leaving the safety of the Donald Sub)

Enough reflection  though, my point is we all knew it was risky for the DNC to run with Clinton, i wish i took screen shots of all the times i read on reddit that Bernie had the best chance of Beating Trump. For a a while after the DNC chose Hillary the Bernie fans here Scolded the DNC and even accused them of rigging the primaries cheating Sanders out.

Now as a non-American we've watched the polarization of the last legs of the race, Spin is dominating this election on both side, on reddit we mainly see one side people are passionate about the Anyone but Trump agenda, on facebook we can still see the pro Trump agenda pushed  and it is even more redicules.

Now, From what ive seen from the mainstream, reddit and facebook it looks to be already Hilary by a landslide but i guess Trump supporters arent as present in my general online browsing.

The main thing Ive taken from this election is that Sentiment and Fear is far more powerful politically than hope and that regardless of the indicators, history, hypocrisy and blatant spin...people have already chosen whichever candidate they want. People are as biased and each campeigns spin, as biased mainstream media that panders to one side or the other. 

These emails are irrelevent to this election. How many of you have switched sides. If people who have switched side because of the emails would kindly comment i would like to see a glimpse what kind of numbers are out there.

If you are a clinton fan and sticking strong after the emails upvote, if you are a Bernie fan and you are just waiting for a second chance for him to be president, Downvote.

The mere existence of a strong third party has had a major structural effect on Canadian politics. The history of the liberal party is defined by the kinds of moves made during the last election, one the main reasons they've lasted so long and formed so many governments. If the vote can be split along more granular lines than 'right and left' it creates the need to co opt policies to prevent support moving towards the more responsive party. 

With electoral support pretty much locked in through a broad binary, policy logically only remains responsive to donors and other powerful groups. The real difference in democrat and republican policy is reflected in what sector of the US plutocratic class has backed a given side. (Canada is of course not totally immune to this)

Yes, the downside is that involvement from more than 2 parties increases the distortion between the actual make up of Parliament and the popular vote but the actual policies pushed forward by the dominant bloc have a tendency by necessity to be more representative.

politics,t5_2cneq,augustdazed,2,FALSE,t3_5a5zty,"I appreciate your rigor here. But, I can't explain this to you it is multi-dimension problem.

I will try though.

Exit-polls are accurate because they sample the population. Actual voters. 

Pre-voting polls do not sample actual voters. They through various means attempt to sample ""likely voters.""  So get out a piece of paper and draw a coordinate system with ""actual voters"" in the center. And then throw a couple of darts at it to get a representative sample of ""likely voters.""  All pre-voting polls do just this. Now, some polls target only a subsection of ""likely voters"" those you are calling ""biased.""  Some, have low numbers or other problems, those you are calling poor quality, but no polls are centered on ""Actual voters"" unless by pure chance your dart hit the center.

The ""Sampling"" error reported is about the dart hole. NOT about the position of the ""Actual voter.""

So when you average the polls, what they are doing is converting this 2-dimensional sheet and aligning all the holes on top of each other. You can weight the sampling from that coninciding point all you want the actual error is still that whole sheet. 

Beyond the ""likely"" vs. ""actual"" voter issues you have the cognitive bias of the ""survey effect.""  

Unless all polls ask the same questions, in the same manner and tone, this ""survey error"" will be different and is BEYOND the sampling error reported. And I am not talking about the ""House Effect.""  

https://www.amazon.com/Psychology-Survey-Response-Roger-Tourangeau/dp/0521576296

It has been found that just by surveying people you get skewed results. 

And, each poll skews in different ways. 

There is a Machine Learning Group that is getting good data. It is AI something and is using Twitter. It is not surveying or polling and it is sampling millions of users to determine who actually will vote and what their vote will be.

EDIT: I realize there is a slight error in this example but honestly I have no way of explaining this as it is a multi-dimensional error problem.

Don't forget, the Democratic party is a club and they decide who gets to play in their clubhouse.  Sure, many arguments can be made about the primary but he made a commitment, and one of the reasons we all love him is because he is a man of his word.  Second, do you think they would have let him keep his seniority on any of his committees if he hadn't endorsed her?  NOT. A. FUCKING. CHANCE!!!  He is on 8 committees and would have been booted from them all.  He is in line to be the head of the budgetary committee, you know, where they craft the US budget.  There is also the potential for him to head the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee. You know, where things like single payer healthcare is covered.  Had he not endorsed her he would be sitting at home on the couch with his grandkids. If you've studied his career at all, he is about policy first and foremost.  Given he was the Amendment King in both the house and senate can you trust he may actually know how to get things done?  He only loses if people go back to being complacent whiners who can't see the big picture. 

By endorsing Hillary he lives to continue to fight for his progressive ideas. As Bernie has pointed out too many times to count, under Trump, everything we all fought for would be DEAD.

Just look how much money he raised about a week and a half ago...2 million dollars for down ballot progressives!

Republicans, prior to friday, had started to think of Comey as a political agent of the democrats because of the fact that he passed on any charges for Clinton.  If that was Comey's last business before it became revealed that the FBI was investigating Donald Trump and those closest to him, and they then brought charges, the Republicans would have gone crazy on him, possibly endangering the investigation.

Comey had to prove that he was acting in good faith to allow the FBI to continue going after Manafort, and possibly Trump.  And the best way he could do this was showing that they were also investigating the Clinton campaign. 

But also consider this.  Any charges that would come out of the Russia/Trump investigation would happen after the election.  The smart money has been on Hillary, at least since the debates, and it's a pretty un-American thing -- and a terrible precedent -- for one president to pursue charges on the person they just defeated in the election.
